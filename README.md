# Analyzing Performance of Pre-trained Models in Detecting Sentiments of Code Mixed Manglish Text Reviews from Social Media

Focuses on processing code mixed Mangish text reviews, which is a mixture of Malayalam and English languages, represented in Roman script. Also it evaluates
the performance of different pre-trained models like mBERT, DistilBERT(multilingual), RoBERTa, XLM and XLNET to determine the sentiment class of Manglish text reviews from the
Dravidian code mix repository and identify which performs better in the context
